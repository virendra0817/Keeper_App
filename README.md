# Keeper_App
**# 📝 Keeper App

A full-stack note-taking application where you can create and delete notes in the browser, with persistent storage powered by PostgreSQL.

## 📖 Description

The **Keeper App** is a simple yet functional note-taking tool built with a **React frontend** and a **Node.js + Express + PostgreSQL backend**.

- On the **frontend**, users can:
  - Create new notes by entering a title and content.
  - Delete existing notes with a single click.
  
- On the **backend**:
  - A PostgreSQL table stores and retrieves notes.
  - New notes are saved to the database when submitted.
  - Deleted notes are removed from the database.

This ensures that your notes persist between sessions and the interface always stays in sync with the stored data.
